                <h1>Content models</h1>
                <p>In HTML 4 there were only two main content models, block and inline level elements. 
                <strong>Block level</strong>  
                elements would stack on top of each other in normal document flow while 
                inline level elements typically appear within the flow of text content.</p> 

                <p>In this example the heading 1 and the paragraphs are block level items, 
                while the bold tags and the link below are examples of inline level elements.</p>

                <p>In HTML5 new content models have been created to expand the structure and semantic capabilities of HTML. 
                There are seven main models: 
                <strong>Flow, Metadata, Embedded, Interactive, Heading, Phrasing, and Sectioning. </strong>
